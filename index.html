                            The nature of hand-addressed envelopes will vary from that of
                                          printed addresses. Each address will vary depending on the
                                          letters, length or names, street names, city, and state length and
                                          will visually appear different from one another when compared.
                                          Addresses with 4 to 5 lines of text will look different from those
                                          with fewer. Please have this expectation set when ordering
                                          calligraphy. Each envelope is a single work of art and must be

                            The post office reads envelopes electronically. Due to the nature
                                          of calligraphy, some addresses or calligraphy styles will be more
                                          or less difficult to tread when putting through the USPS, as in
                                          the nature of any handwritten address. Any address that can not be
                                          ready by machine will most likely be hand-inspected. If the
                                          address still can not be delivered, it will be returned to the
                                          address of the return. Vendor is not responsible for resending,
                                          reprinting or reimbursing for invitations or addresses that do not
                                          make it to their intended address. As with any mass mailing, you
                                          are likely to have 1-3% of your pieces be undeliverable. Please
                                          check your address list carefully to ensure all your addresses are
                                          correct to minimize this effect. You may wish to order an
                                          additional 10% of your pieces to ensure additional pieces are
                                          available if needed for remaining. If Vendor is addressing and
                                          posting your pieces, Vendor guarantees that each address Client
                                          provides goes into the mail. Any mail not received by its intended
                                          recipient is not under the liability of Vendor. If any pieces need
                                          to be re-mailed, you may either mail the piece yourself from the
                                          excess mailed back to you upon completion of the project, or pay
                                          Vendor to bring, address and re-mail the additional pieces at the
